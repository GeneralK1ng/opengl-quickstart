# OpenGL Project Template

EN | [中文](README.md)

This project aims to quickly set up an OpenGL project, helping you skip the cumbersome configuration process.

## Environment Requirements

- MinGW
- CMake
- Freeglut

Please note that I am using Windows, and I am not familiar with configurations for Mac.

## How to Use

You can clone this repository, or use this template to create a new repository in your GitHub account and then pull it to your local machine:

```shell
git clone <your repo>
```

Make sure you have MinGW configured correctly.

Then, simply run CMake, compile, and run the project, and you should see a rotating cube.

Mac users are welcome to provide compatibility suggestions!
